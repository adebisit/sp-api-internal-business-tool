# SP API INTERNAL BUSINESS TOOL
This tool was developed while I worked with a privately held organization that was a group of Amazon Sellers. The application started in 2018 and evolved over the years from using Amazon MWS to using [Amazon Selling Partner (SP) API](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/). The repository only contains the more later evolved code.

The application can be integrated into other Amazon businesses to implement a logical solution that allows for communication to Amazon SP-API.



## Features

- Add Items to Amazon Inventory
- Create Shipment Plan (***deprecated***)
- Automated process of request report to get report result
- Get Orders and Refund Information stored in DB
- Item Fees information.
- Slack Notifications.


## Requirements & Installations
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/first-steps-with-celery.html#installing-celery)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/download/)
- [Postgres SQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- For Window users, I recommend installing [Ubuntu on WSL](https://ubuntu.com/wsl) to run local development



## Running the Server Locally
#### STEP 1: Prepare Virtual Environments and Packages
Create a virtual enviroment, activate it and install packages in requirements.txt
```
python3 -m venv env -m
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### STEP 2: Add Environment Variables
A list of environment variables are found in the .env.example file in the root folder.

- **App Variables**: `SECRET_KEY` `DEBUG`
- **SP-API Variables**: `REFRESH_TOKEN` `LWA_APP_ID` `LWA_CLIENT_SECRET` `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` `AWS_SECRET_KEY` `ROLE_ARN`
- **Database Variables**: `DB_HOST` `DB_NAME` `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_PORT` `DB_USER`
- **Slack Variables (Optional)**: `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` `SLACK_SCRIPT_UPDATE_CHANNEL`

#### STEP 3: Run Development Servers
Django Development Server
```
> python manage.py runserver
```
Redis:
```
> redis-server
```
Celery:
```
> celery -A AmazonApp worker --loglevel=INFO 
```
Celery Beat:
```
> celery -A AmazonApp beat --loglevel=INFO -S django --pidfile /tmp/celerybeat.pid
```


## Usage
Because the application is used internally, there was little to no need for authentication api. Implementing an authenticaion feature is pretty easy to implement anyway.

For a small team, you can create a superuser in django and follow prompt accordingly
```
> python manage.py createuser
```

The application uses Django Rest Framework Auth Token and a new token can be generated by making sending a POST request to the token generation endpoint:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"your_username", "password":"your_password"}' http://localhost/api/token/

```

Token can now be included with any request body to validate requests.

Postman Documentation for endpoints is available [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/23128311/2s93kxcRjC)
